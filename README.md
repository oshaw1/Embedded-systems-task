# Embedded-systems-task
In an embedded systems module, I used a Raspberry Pi to create a range of embedded systems using various different hardware components and sensors. The Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost computer that is well-suited for use in embedded systems because of its compact size, low power consumption and ability to interface with a wide range of sensors and hardware devices.

One of the projects I worked on was a home automation system, which used a Raspberry Pi to control various devices such as lights and appliances. I connected sensors such as motion detectors and temperature sensors to the Raspberry Pi, and wrote code to enable the system to respond to sensor inputs by turning devices on or off.

Another project was a weather monitoring system, where I interfaced a range of sensors such as temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure sensors to the Raspberry Pi. I wrote code to collect data from the sensors, and then used that data to display real-time weather information on a small display.

I also developed a security system using a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi, that would take pictures and videos when motion was detected.

Throughout the module, I learned how to interface with a wide range of hardware components and sensors, as well as how to write code to control those devices. I also gained experience working with the Raspberry Pi and understanding the capabilities and limitations of the platform. It was a challenging but rewarding module that allowed me to apply my knowledge of programming and embedded systems to real-world projects.

Note: This is an example of only a couple of tasks
